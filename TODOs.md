# To-do list

- forms -- figure out how to display $$$
- offers: display more data in rows and columns -- beautify
- classes: display the class name and grad date
- landing/nav: figure out the best way to do a landing page that won't show back up as long as the person is using the site...i think more like a splash page
- add styling
- create some kind of home page that explains the purpose
- fix loading spinner on classes
- on button submit, exit the modal
