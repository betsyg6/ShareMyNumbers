# To-do list

- forms -- beautify
- offers: display more data in rows and columns
- classes: display the class name and grad date
- landing/nav: figure out the best way to do a landing page that won't show back up as long as the person is using the site...i think more like a splash page
- add styling
- create some kind of home page that explains the purpose
